# Instruct.ai

Everyone has had that one professor who, despite their best intentions, just is unable to grab the undivided attention of the class. What options do these professors do to improve their students' attentiveness during their lectures? They could peruse through hastily answered surveys littered. They could entice students to pay attention by adding exclusive information during lectures that pertain to exams. OR, they could use Instruct.ai. Instruct.ai is an application which uses computer vision and speech recognition to identify the exact points in a professor's lecture during which the average inattentiveness of the students is the greatest. Professors simply have to upload a video recording of their lecture facing the audience, and Instruct.ai will do the rest, showing them exactly which concepts fragments they need to do a better job of teaching.
