I was going to ,81.4,second15
show you some pretty ,84.6,second16
pictures today but this ,85.7,second17
whole setup is a complete ,86.4,second18
mystery to me ,87.6,second19
I looks like ,91.6,second20
it looks like ,94.4,second21
a touch screen ,95,second22
computer ,84.4,second23
I ,97,second24
can get it to ,93.6,second25
react I'll just have to ,81.6,second26
draw ,80.4,second27
so we got to ,81.3,second29
move on ,82.4,second30
